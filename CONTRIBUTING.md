Here's a few guidelines for contributing to this repo:
* Point your pull requests to the `dev` branch. They will be merged with `master` before making a new release.
* Discuss changes on our Discord server mentioned below.
* Do not make a pull request proposing support for CommonJS. CommonJS support can be achieved by purely replacing `export default` in the `index.js` file with `module.exports`.
